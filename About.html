<h1>In our day to day life we consume food 
and our survival is predicated on mainly food. A 
considerable amount of our food is coming from 
farms and other means too. These farmers do their 
hard work for growing and serving many lives across 
the country, which pays for their source of income. 
But thanks to intermediates within the selling of their 
final products the farmers are unable to form their 
profit and mostly live poor. By this project we will be 
able to connect farmers directly to the customer so 
that direct dealing of products can be accomplished. 
This will end in a big decrease within the prices of 
the products currently available within the market 
also because the profit will directly reach the farmers 
pocket..</h1>
